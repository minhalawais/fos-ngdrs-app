# DELIVERABLES NCSW CAN ISSUE

To operationalize, NCSW should publish:

**1. Notification** mandating provincial police + shelters to use the format
**2. Data Submission Frequency: Monthly** → consolidated quarterly
**3. Provincial Focal Points:** KPIs tied to compliance
**4. Transparency Protocol:** Annual report published publicly
