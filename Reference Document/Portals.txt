Data Governance & Security Architecture
Layer	Data Privacy	Retention	Responsibility
District	PII Enabled: Full survivor details for case management.	Active Case Life	District Focal Point
Province	PII Masked: Only Year, District, and Case ID for auditing.	5 Years	Provincial WDD / WPC
NCSW	Anonymized: Aggregate trends and pattern summaries only.	Permanent (Policy Use)	NCSW Data Unit
[!IMPORTANT] Technical Implementation Note: All three portals should be connected via a secure API bridge that scrubs PII (Personally Identifiable Information) automatically as data moves from District to National levels, ensuring compliance with SOP 4.
